**Should I file this?**
Use this template to report *observed bugs in current Plotman*.  Do not use this to request tech support or troubleshooting; we are unable to provide that support here, so please use the user channel(s) on Keybase, or GitHub Discussions instead.  Do not use this to report issues with the core Chia plotter.  Because the `development` branch often contains new fixes not yet released, you may also want to try installing it to see if it addresses your issue (you can do this by following the install instructions but specifying `@development` instead of `@main`).
