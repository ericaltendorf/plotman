# Options for display and rendering
user_interface:
        # Call out to the `stty` program to determine terminal size, instead of
        # relying on what is reported by the curses library.   In some cases,
        # the curses library fails to update on SIGWINCH signals.  If the
        # `plotman interactive` curses interface does not properly adjust when
        # you resize the terminal window, you can try setting this to True. 
        use_stty_size: True

# Where to plot and log.
directories:
        # One directory in which to store all plot job logs (the STDOUT/
        # STDERR of all plot jobs).  In order to monitor progress, plotman
        # reads these logs on a regular basis, so using a fast drive is
        # recommended.
        log: /home/chia/chia/logs

        # One or more directories to use as tmp dirs for plotting.  The
        # scheduler will use all of them and distribute jobs among them.
        # It assumes that IO is independent for each one (i.e., that each
        # one is on a different physical device).
        #
        # If multiple directories share a common prefix, reports will
        # abbreviate and show just the uniquely identifying suffix.
        tmp:
                - /mnt/tmp/00
                - /mnt/tmp/01
                - /mnt/tmp/02
                - /mnt/tmp/03

        # Optional: Allows overriding some characteristics of certain tmp
        # directories. This contains a map of tmp directory names to
        # attributes. If a tmp directory and attribute is not listed here,
        # it uses the default attribute setting from the main configuration.
        #
        # Currently support override parameters:
        #     - tmpdir_max_jobs
        tmp_overrides:
                # In this example, /mnt/tmp/00 is larger than the other tmp
                # dirs and it can hold more plots than the default.
                "/mnt/tmp/00":
                        tmpdir_max_jobs: 5

        # Optional: tmp2 directory.  If specified, will be passed to
        # chia plots create as -2.  Only one tmp2 directory is supported.
        # tmp2: /mnt/tmp/a

        # Optional: A list of one or more directories; the scheduler will
        # use all of them.  These again are presumed to be on independent
        # physical devices so writes (plot jobs) and reads (archivals) can
        # be scheduled to minimize IO contention.
        # 
        # If dst is commented out, the tmp directories will be used as the
        # buffer.
        dst:
                - /mnt/dst/00
                - /mnt/dst/01

        # Archival configuration.  Optional; if you do not wish to run the
        # archiving operation, comment this section out.  Almost everyone
        # should be using the archival feature.  It is meant to distribute
        # plots among multiple disks filling them all.  This can be done both
        # to local and to remote disks.
        #
        # As of v0.4, archiving commands are highly configurable.  The basic
        # configuration consists of a script for checking available disk space
        # and another for actually transferring plots.  Each can be specified
        # as either a path to an existing script or inline script contents.
        # It is expected that most people will use existing recipes and will
        # adjust them by specifying environment variables that will set their
        # system specific values.  These can be provided to the scripts via
        # the `env` key.  plotman will additionally provide `source` and
        # `destination` environment variables to the transfer script so it
        # knows the specifically selected items to process.  plotman also needs
        # to be able to generally detect if a transfer process is already
        # running.  To be able to identify externally launched transfers, the
        # process name and an argument prefix to match must be provided.  Note
        # that variable substitution of environment variables including those
        # specified in the env key can be used in both process name and process
        # argument prefix elements but that they use the python substitution
        # format.
