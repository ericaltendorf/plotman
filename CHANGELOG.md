# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]
### Fixed
- Detects binary-installed Chia plotting processes again after being broken in v0.5.
  ([#865](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/865))
- Wrap archival indexes around when there are fewer disks, rather than just pointing all the "extra" indexes at the last disk.
  This will distribute the plot transfers better when you have fewer disks than plotters.
  ([#855](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/855))
### Added
- `path_suffix` option for rsync and rsyncd archive targets.
  Allows adding suffixes to the destination path such as to separate original vs. pool plots.
  ([#800](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/800))
- `executable` option for each configurable plotter.
  Allows explicit specification of the plotter executable path if this is preferred over setting the `PATH` environment variable to find the program.
  Presently does not support executables other than the expected names (`chia`, and `chia_plot`).
  ([#823](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/823))
- New rsyncd target definition which removes a single file after archiving based on a file glob (for replotting)

## [0.5] - 2021-07-07
### Fixed
- `plotman kill` doesn't leave any temporary files behind anymore.
  ([#801](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/801))
### Added
- tmp directory overrides moved to `scheduling:` `tmp_overrides:`.
  ([#758](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/758))
- Per tmp directory phase limit control added to `scheduling:` `tmp_overrides:`.
  ([#758](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/758))
- `plotman export` command to output summaries from plot logs in `.csv` format.
  ([#557](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/557))
- `--json` option for `plotman status`.
  ([#549](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/549))
- If the tmp drive selected for a plot is also listed as a dst drive then plotman will use the same drive for both.
  ([#643](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/643))
- `plotman prometheus` command to output status for consumption by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
  ([#430](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/430))
- `plotman logs` command to print and tail plot logs by their plot ID.
  ([#509](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/509))
- Support the [madMAx plotter](https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter).
  See the [configuration wiki page](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/wiki/Configuration#2-v05) for help setting it up.
  ([#797](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/797))
- Added argument `-f`/`--force` to `plotman kill` to skip confirmation before killing the job.
  ([#801](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/801))
- Docker container support.
  See the [docker configuration wiki page](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/wiki/Docker-Configuration) for help setting it up.
  ([#783](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/783))
- Plot sizes other than k32 are handled.
  ([#803](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/pull/803))

## [0.4.1] - 2021-06-11
### Fixed
- Archival disk space check finds drives with multiple mount points again.
  This fixes a regression introduced in v0.4.1.
  ([#773](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/issues/773))
- `plotman dirs` does not fail for every invocation.
  `TypeError: dirs_report() missing 1 required positional argument: 'width'`
  ([#778](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/issues/778))

## [0.4] - 2021-06-10
### Fixed
- More accurately calculates expected size of plots.
- Archival requires only minimal extra space on target drive.
  The required space is based on the size of the actual plot to be transferred.
  Previously a 20% (~20GB) margin was required relative to a rough approximation of plot size.
- Identify more cases of chia plotting processes such as on NixOS.
- Avoid some more `NoSuchProcess` and `AccessDenied` errors when identifying plotting processes.
- Avoid crashing when parsing plotting process logs fails to decode due to `UnicodeDecodeError`.
- Avoid crashing when a tmp file is removed while we are checking a job's tmp usage.
- Windows is not yet supported, but plot and archive processes are now launched to be independent of the plotman process on Windows as it already was on Linux.
### Added
- Configuration file is versioned.
  The config for previous plotman versions has been retroactively defined to be version 0
  The new version is 1.
  An error will be raised when you launch plotman with a configuration file whose version does not match the expected configuration version.
  That error will include a link to the wiki to help understand the needed changes.
  See [the wiki configuration page](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/wiki/Configuration#1-v04).
- Archiving configuration has been reworked offering both a simple builtin local archiving setup as well as arbitrary configuration of the disk space check and transfer operations.
  See [the wiki archiving page](https://github.com/ericaltendorf/plotman/wiki/Archiving)
- The `directories:` `dst:` section is optional.
  If not specified then generally the tmp drive for the plot will be used as dst.
  If tmp2 is specified then it will be used as dst.
- Along with plot logs, there are now archive transfer logs and an overall plotman log.
  This helps with diagnosing issues with both the archival disk space check and the archival transfers.
  The paths are configurable under `logging:` via `plots:` (directory), `transfers:` (directory), and `application:` (file).
- Added support for `-c`/`--pool_contract_address`.
  Configurable as `plotting:` `pool_contract_address:`.
- Interactive can be launched with plotting and archiving inactive.
  This is available via the configuration file in `commands:` `interactive:` `autostart_plotting:` and `autostart_archiving:`.
  They are also available on the command line as `--[no-]autostart-plotting` and `--[no-]autostart-archiving`. 
- Uses `i` to differentiate between gigabytes vs. gibibytes, for example.
  `Gi` vs. `G`.
